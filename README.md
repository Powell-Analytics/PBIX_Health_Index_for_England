# Health Index for England Power BI Project

Every year ONS releases the Health Index for England.
The ONSâ€™ Health Index provides a systematic, independent view of health in England. It enables users to compare health over time and across geographies.

It provides a picture of health in its broadest sense recognising the importance of health outcomes, risk factors and the social, economic and environmental drivers to support health to improve now and for the longer term.

Using a simple template, this Power BI dashboard will easily present the data and allow for easy update year on year.  

Please Note: All data used is publically available.
